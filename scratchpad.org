* Setup
** Each class starts with 0 to 2 adjectives that apply to it, and values for 1 to 3 numeric variables (or are there just a few variables universe-wide and they apply to everything (like temperature or mass for any physical object)?
*** numeric vars should probably be drawn from a normal distribution in some cases and a power law distribution in others
** We define n_ops operations, taken from one of the following types:
*** If a noun1 verbs a noun2, noun2 becomes adjective (if it was already adjective, it remains adjective).
**** Maybe there's a specific subset of nouns which a noun1 can verb
*** If a noun1 verbs a noun2, noun2 stops being adjective (if it was already not adjective, it remains not adjective).
**** Maybe there's a specific subset of nouns which a noun1 can verb
*** If a noun1 verbs a noun2, the variable of noun2 is incremented or multiplied by some value.
*** If a noun1 verbs a noun2, some of noun1's variable is transferred to noun2.
*** Versions of all the above where instead of noun1, the scientist can verb a noun2.
*** And/or: sometimes a noun1 can verb anything, or a noun2 can be verbed BY anything.
** We define n_constraints constraints, eg
*** Only adjective objects can verb
** We create k_objects objects each of which is of some noun type.
** We run k_initial_ops operations on random objects.
* Starting (everything from here is visible to the scientist)
** We describe the existing objects, including whatever adjectives apply to each, eg 'Object 1 is a drazzle. It is fribbly.'
** We run n4 operations on random objects, describing any changes.
*** Maybe we ensure that some changes are made to the variable of objects of the class we're going to ask about
** We
*** ask the scientist to explain why some objects are <adjective> and others aren't?
*** ask the scientist to find a way to predict the value of <variable> for some class.
** The scientist can
*** Examine objects, which reveals their adjectives (if we don't just say that up front, which we probably should)
*** Run experiments with one of n_vars instruments eg scale
*** Cause a chosen operation to run on a chosen noun, or to be performed by noun1 to noun2.
* Possible variations
** Skip noun types, make everything the same type and just deal with adjectives? Probably not.
** Add n_vars numeric variables eg mass? <variable> will always refer to one of these.
** Make some variables dependent on others
** We can create some relationship between two numeric vars, with causality in one or both directions (eg: increasing something's height will increase its mass)
** Create causal relationships as primary rather than operations?
